Here's what I'm up to right now:

Trying to figure out Jekyll and Git: [[About this site]]. Trying to figure out [[My Obsidian workflow]] for publishing new notes here. Reading Continuous Discovery Habits by Teresa Torres, listening to Brave New World by Aldous Huxley (here's more [Book I've read in 2022](website/_notes/Book%20I've%20read%20in%202022.md)). Very behind on processing my inbox of notes and snippets from books and articles I've read recently. Loving part-time worker life, hanging out with my kids, generally feeling more relaxed and inspired. Not doing much [art](tags/art.html) lately, but maybe soon once I've gotten this site to a good place. Playing with the idea of what is enough: enough money, enough things, enough work, enough space.

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first.
