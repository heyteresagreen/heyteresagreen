Here's what I'm up to right now:

Trying to figure out Jekyll and Git: [[About this site]]. Trying to figure out [[My Obsidian workflow]] for publishing new notes here. Reading Continuous Discovery Habits by Teresa Torres, listening to Brave New World by Aldous Huxley. Very behind on processing my inbox of notes and snippets from books and articles I've read recently. Loving part-time worker life, hanging out with my kids, generally feeling more relaxed and inspired. Not painting much lately, but maybe soon once I've gotten this site to a good place. Playing with the idea of what is enough: enough money, enough things, enough work, enough space.

This "Now" page was inspired by the [/Now page movement](https://nownownow.com/about) , and also [sanlive](http://sanlive.com) where I saw it first.
