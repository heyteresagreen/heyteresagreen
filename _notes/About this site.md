This site is a little experiment into writing, Indieweb and digital gardening. 

## Just the facts
This site is made with Jekyll, specifically the [Jekyll digital garden theme](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll) (with some slight adjustments). It's published with GitHub and Netlify, don't ask me how it all works. Fonts are Georgia + Helvetica Neue (if you have it installed, Arial if you don't). I write notes in [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) and use [this plugin](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher) to publish to my Github.

## Done so far
* Registered with Github and Netlify
* Set up a new public repository with a [Jekyll theme](https://maximevaillancourt.com/blog/setting-up-your-own-digital-garden-with-jekyll)
* Set it up to deploy via Netlify
* Got it publishing to [https://heyteresagreen.netlify.app/](https://heyteresagreen.netlify.app/)
* Some very basic styling and writingBasic styling
* Put a logo in the header
* Start here note
* Figure out a good workflow that can be done via iPad, via Obsidian + [this plugin](https://github.com/ObsidianPublisher/obsidian-github-publisher))

## To do
* Figure out tags, maybe using [this plugin method](https://uhded.com/automatic-jekyll-categories-page)
* Disable link previews
