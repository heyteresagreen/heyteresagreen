![painting of a kangaroo with bright pinks and purples](assets/roo.jpeg)

Trying to push towards high key colours, helped by the reference pic of a white kangaroo I took a photo of at Caversham Park.

Painted in [Procreate](https://procreate.com/) using the [Perfect Oils](https://creativemarket.com/Ldarro/6441075-Perfect-OILS-87-brushes-4PROCREATE) brush set, mainly IMPASTO 3.0|Fechine's Expressive #1 which does some lovely mixing.
