You might have been looking for ChiGarden, which was my blog for fifteen years. I've decided to close that chapter and start afresh over here. Some of my old content might someday make its way across, but quite likely I'll never get around to it.

I've saved a static version of the site so I can dip back into the memories when I feel like it - 475 posts and over 17k files all up (thanks Wordpress!). I haven't been writing so much there for the past few years, due to having kids and feeling like I needed something worthy of saying to start a post. Here, somehow I'm not feeling the weight of a long blog history.
