I"ó<p>I recently left a job that I was really enjoying for an opportunity that came up at another company. I wasnâ€™tÂ <em>not</em>Â looking, but I also didnâ€™t really expect to leave until the more I thought about the idea the more I liked it. Iâ€™m in a very privileged position to be in a field which currently has a bit of demand at a senior level, so this was the first time I had the luxury of being able to be picky knowing that Iâ€™d continue to be happy at my old job if nothing came up.</p>
