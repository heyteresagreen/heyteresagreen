I"¬<p>Iâ€™ve found that Iâ€™m very good at procrastination under the guise of productivity. Usually this starts with wanting to do a relatively simple thing, and ends up with taking a deep dive into finding just the right tool or process to really optimise it. Going down this rabbit hole /feels/ productive, but often itâ€™s not really proportionate to the actual thing I want to do, and enables me to just put it off longer.</p>
